`sktime-dl` is currently being ported to mini-packages within `sktime`, and no longer maintained.

Most estimators formerly in `sktime-dl` are now available in the `sktime.classification.deep_learning` and `sktime.regression.deep_learning` modules, and maintained there.

Contributions are appreciated to port the rest!

To contribute, follow instructions in the [umbrella planning issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3351) on the `sktime` repo.
